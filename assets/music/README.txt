Music Files Directory

To add your own music to the Panda Diary app:

1. Place your .mp3 files in this directory
2. Update the playlist array in script.js with your song information:

Example:
{
    title: "Your Song Title",
    artist: "Artist Name", 
    src: "assets/music/your-song.mp3"
}

The app will automatically handle missing music files and show a friendly message.

Recommended: Use ambient, peaceful music for the best diary writing experience!
